                    Pylint is a static code checker for python that checks for errors, shows when you stray from a coding standard and looks for code “smells”. A “code smell” is something that “seems” wrong, such as a method that's too long or doesn't have any methods. This is basically a warning that needs to be looked into, however, most times what smells wrong is wrong.

                        <b>Factory:</b> A Factory Design Pattern is a way to design your code so that objects are created without exposing the logic to the client. A factory method can create multiple types of objects. It takes an input, and based on the input it creates a type of object.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Instantiation:</b> Instantiation is the creation of an object by calling its constructor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Object:</b> An object is an instance of a class. The object has its own copy of the class properties and methods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Class:</b> A class is a container for properties and methods. Class methods and properties may be accessed by an object of that class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Namespace:</b> Namespace is the scope of a property or method.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Constructor:</b> A constructor is the method that instantiates an object.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Fixture:</b> A fixture is a method that can be passed to a test method to setup the conditions for the test.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Type hint:</b> A type hint specifies the type of a variable or the return type of a method. Below, str specifies the type of name as a string, and “→ str” specifies the return type as a string.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Type cast:</b> A type cast converts a variable of one type to another type.
                        “str(456) will convert the integer 456 to a string.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Unit test:</b> unittest is a module in python's library which contains tools for testing your code. Unit testing involves creating a test function which calls the application method, passes parameters if appropriate, and tests that the return value is correct.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Static:</b> A static method in python is a method that can be called without creating an object. Static methods are good for utility functions. They are totally self-contained and only work with data passed in as arguments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Class method:</b> A class method in python can also be called without creating an object. Class methods are methods that are related to a class and have access to all class-specific data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Facade:</b> Facade Design Pattern provides a high level interface that multiple subsystems can use. The Facade hides complexity of the system and provides a simple interface to to the client.
                        Calculator class is a facade for calculations. Calculator wraps calculations class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Design Patterns:</b>
                        <div><b>Factory Pattern:</b> Allows you to create objects without first specifying what type of object you are creating. The Factory Method will create the appropriate object.</div>
                        <p><b>Builder Pattern:</b> Requires you to builds a complex object by using a step by step approach. A Builder interface defines the steps to build the final object.</p>
                        <p><b>Abstract Factory Pattern:</b> The abstract factory pattern is used to provide a client with a set of related or dependant objects. The "family" of objects created by the factory are determined at run-time.</p>
                        <p><b>Prototype Pattern:</b> Create a new object instance from another similar instance and then modify according to our requirements.</p>
                        <p><b>The Singleton Pattern:</b> Ensures that only one instance of a class is instantiated. All references to objects of a singlton class refer back to the same instance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Method:</b> A method is a container for a group of commands that perform one function. A method can be called from another method that needs that particular function performed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Property:</b> The Property Decorator allows you to access a class method as you would a class attribute. No () are needed.
