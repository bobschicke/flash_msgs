                Encapsulation using a class encloses, or wraps variables and methods in s group whose members have
                protected access. In a class, external access is only allowed to methods or variables that are
                designated as public. Generally the data is private (non-excessible) except by using special public
                functions frequently called setters and getters. The same is true for functions that deal with critical
                information such as websites and databases. You want to make the critical methods private and use public
                functions to form a safe barrier.
                <p>
                    In our Calculator project we use encapsulation in all of our classes. For example, our Calculator
                    class encapsulates the add, subtract, multiply and divide methods.

                calculator.py file</a>, which contains the Calculator Class. You can see that this class "Encapsulates"
                multiple methods.

                    With Inheritance, you to have a general parent class that is inherited by the child classes. When a
                    child class inherits a parent class it must implement all the parents methods. This can make sense
                    if the child classes can use most of the methods and variables from the parent.
                    For instance, a parent class “Animals” can have variables that would apply to all animals such as
                    weight, color, height, length, life expectancy, habitat. Some examples of children of animals would
                    be Mammals, Reptiles, Fish, Birds. These child classes would add data and methods that were specific
                    to their class, such as fin size, wing span, hair length.
                    <p>
                        In our Calculator project we have a parent class Calculation that has a tuple “values” and a
                        method to convert “values” to a list of floats. We then have Addition, Subtraction, Multiply and
                        Divide classes that inherit Calculation so that they can use Calculation's members. After
                        inheriting the from Calculation, the children only need to implement a “get_result” function,
                        which needs to be different for each of the operations performed by the children.

                        The way a class inherits from another class is to add the base class as a parameter. You can see

                    Polymorphism means that you have the same function name, but have custom implementations based on
                    the type of object or type of data. One example of this is python's “print” method. For example, the
                    print method has custom implementations for integers, strings, lists. You don't need to be concerned
                    with letting the function know what type of data is being printed. The correct implementation is
                    called based on the data that is passed.
                    You can create your own polymorphism by having a property or method in a parent function and then
                    creating a custom implementation in some of the child classes.
                    <p>
                        We use polymorphism in the Calculator project with the Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and
                        Division classes implement custom “get_result” methods. When get_result(values) is called on any
                        of the classes it returns the value of the operation.

                    Abstraction is the process using a simple interface, such as function calls, to hide the complexity
                    of the underlying code. When you type in a function call, such as the print(“Hello World”) function
                    in python, there may be 100+ lines of code to correctly implement the function. A similar thing is
                    when you type a phone number into your phone, enter a search string in google or turn the key in
                    your car. You do a very simple thing, and a very complex process occurs.
                    In our Calculator project, there are many abstractions that take place.
                    For example, when we call the get_result function, the program loops through the values and performs
                    the operations and then returns the result. The code of the get_result function is hidden from the
                    caller.
                    <p>
                        And in another layer of abstraction, there is library code that implements the program code
                        above. As programmers we don't necessarily care how a “for” loop is coded in the library. We
                        just need to know how to use it in the program code we write. In the early days of programming,
                        you had to program in machine code. Now we can write 10 lines of code in a few minutes that does
                        more than a program that used to take a week to write on 1000 punch cards, all thanks to
                        abstraction.
                    </p>
                    In our Calculator project, we can instantiate an Addition object, pass it the list of values, do the
                    calculation and get the result by writing the following command:
                    <br><code>Addition(values).get_result()</code>
                    <br>When the above command is run, all the code in the 2 blocks of code below is run. Imagine having
                    to write all that code everytime you wanted to do a calculation? Thank goodness for abstraction!
